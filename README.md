# Hi, I'm Jalal Safari ðŸ‘‹
I am a researcher specializing in the development of immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality (XR) applications.

## ðŸ§­ My Journey So Far
My work focuses on the intersection of Extended Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Geospatial Information Systems, with a strong emphasis on creating practical solutions for education, health, and environmental challenges.

## ðŸ§  Areas of Expertise
I have a demonstrated track record of expertise in the following key areas:

- **Extended Reality (VR/AR/Metaverse)**: My research in this domain covers a wide range of applications, from educational tools to complex interactive systems. Key contributions include:

  - **Interactive Systems**: Pioneering work in object placement, manipulation, and multi-modal interaction with virtual agents.

  - **Educational Applications**: Creating immersive pedagogical tools for learning geospatial topics and foundational concepts.

  - **Social XR**: Research into enabling group collaboration and emotional recognition within cross-reality environments.

- **AI & Machine Learning**: I apply advanced AI and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems, often within XR environments. My work includes:

  - **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning to predict environmental factors like flood susceptibility and PM2.5 pollution.

  - **Deep Learning**: Developing deep neural network models for time-series predictions.

  - **NLP & AI Integration**: Exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in immersive learning environments.
